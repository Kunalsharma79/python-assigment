        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular\n",
        "  - Python is a high-level programming language. its known for its simple, English-like syntax its  easy for beginners to learn and fast for professionals to write.It is  popular because its massive ecosystem of libraries, which allows it to dominate fields like Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and web development.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python\n",
        "  - Python Interpreter is a program that acts as a translator between you and your computer.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python\n",
        "  - pre-defined keywords are special, reserved words that have a fixed meaning and function in python . You cannot use them as names for your variables, functions, or classes because the Python interpreter uses them to understand the structure and logic of your code.its pre defined keywords in python.\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names\n",
        "    - you can't use keywords as variable name because they have fixed meaning and function in python if you do it will throw and sytenx error.\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python\n",
        "   - Mutability means to whether an object's value can be modified after it is created: Mutable objects (like lists) can be changed in place.while string and  tuples can't be altered.\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable\n",
        "    - Lists are mutable to provide a flexible \"workbench\" for data that needs frequent updating, adding, or removing during a program's execution. its  like shopping beg\n",
        "  - Tuples are immutable to act as fixed \"records,\" ensuring data    integrity  and allowing for faster performance and lower memory usage.like atm number ,aadhar card number etc\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python .\n",
        " - the, == checks for value equality, while \"is\" checks for identity  (memory location).\n",
        " or you can say that\"== \"returs true if the contents of two objects are the same, even if they are stored in different places.\n",
        " is (Identity): Returns True only if both variables point to the exact same object in the computer's memory.\n",
        "8.  What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        " - Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements and perform \"True/False\" logic. They allow your program to make decisions based on multiple criteria.\n",
        " there are 2 types logical operaters\n",
        " and -- its true if both statement  are true\n",
        " or --- its true if atleast one of statement is true\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python\n",
        " - Type casting is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another (for example, turning a string into an integer).\n",
        "10.  What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting\n",
        " - The  difference is automation versus manual control:\n",
        "Implicit Casting: Python automatically converts one type to another (e.g., adding an integer to a float) to prevent data loss without you writing extra code.\n",
        "Explicit Casting: You manually force a conversion using functions like int(), float(), or str() to ensure the data is in the specific format you need.\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python\n",
        " - The purpose of conditional statements is to allow a program to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on whether a specific condition is True or False.without them a program would simply run every line of code in a straight line from top to bottom. Conditionals add \"logic\" by creating branches in the code.\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work\n",
        " - The elif (short for \"else if\") statement allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence. It only runs if the conditions before it were False, and it stops the entire chain as soon as it finds one that is True.\n",
        " python check the firest condintion if its true it will run an skip everything else.\n",
        "13.  What is the difference between for and while loops\n",
        " - The main difference lies in how long the loop runs: a for loop is generally used when you know the number of iterations in advance, while a while loop is used when the number of iterations depends on a specific condition being met.\n",
        "14.  Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        " - A while loop is most suitable in scenarios where the number of iterations is unknown or depends on an external event that hasn't happened yet. lets see\n",
        " Imagine you are building a login screen. You want the program to keep asking the user for their password until they get it right.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why a for loop fails: You can't predict if the user will get it right on the 1st try, the 5th try, or the 50th try. If you use a for loop with a range of 3, the program will just quit after three attempts, even if the user was about to type it correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why a while loop shines: You can set a condition like while password_entered != correct_password:. The loop will run indefinitely until the specific condition (entering the correct password) is finally met."
